# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

- This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch.
- For each algorithm, I have provided:
  1.  A brief explanation of the algorithm
  2.  The mathematical formulation,
  3.  Cost function
  4.  Gradient descent
  5.  Implementation in Python
- The purpose of this repository is to help you understand how these algorithms work under the hood.
